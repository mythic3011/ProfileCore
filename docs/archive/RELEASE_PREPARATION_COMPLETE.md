## 🚀 How to Release

### Step 1: Run Release Script

**Windows:**

```powershell
.\release-v5.1.0.ps1
```

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
./release-v5.1.0.sh
```

The script will:

1. Verify you're in the correct directory
2. Check for uncommitted changes
3. Stage all release files
4. Create release commit
5. Create annotated tag v5.1.0
6. Ask if you want to push to remote

### Step 2: Push to Remote (if not auto-pushed)

```bash
git push origin main
git push origin v5.1.0
```

Or both at once:

```bash
git push origin main v5.1.0
```

### Step 3: Create GitHub Release

1. Go to GitHub repository
2. Click "Releases" → "Create new release"
3. Select tag `v5.1.0`
4. Title: "ProfileCore v5.1.0 - Performance Release"
5. Copy content from `RELEASE_NOTES_v5.1.0.md`
6. Attach `FINAL_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md` as additional documentation
7. Publish release

### Step 4: Announce

**Template:**

```
🚀 ProfileCore v5.1.0 Released!

Performance-focused update:
✅ 63% faster startup (3.3s → 1.2s)
✅ Lazy command loading
✅ Async prompt initialization
✅ No breaking changes

Install: https://github.com/mythic3011/ProfileCore

Benchmark comparison included!
```

## 💡 Key Learnings Documented

### What Worked

✅ **Data-driven profiling** - Measured before optimizing  
✅ **Focus on bottlenecks** - Command registry was 53% of time  
✅ **Simple solutions** - PowerShell > Rust complexity  
✅ **Lazy loading** - Defer expensive operations  
✅ **Async operations** - Non-blocking is powerful

### What Didn't Work

❌ **Rust binary module** - FFI complexity, crashes, DLL locking  
❌ **Assumptions** - Thought module import was slow, was command registry  
❌ **Over-engineering** - Complex solutions for marginal gains

### Key Insight

> "Profile first, optimize second. The command registry was 53% of startup time—not module loading. Data beats assumptions every time."

All lessons documented in:

- `FINAL_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md`
- `docs/archive/rust-experiment/README.md`

---

## 📞 Support Plan

### Monitoring

- Watch GitHub Issues for bug reports
- Monitor Discussions for questions
- Track social media mentions
- Collect performance reports from users

### Response Plan

- Address critical issues within 24h
- Create v5.1.1 patch if needed
- Update documentation based on questions
- Collect feedback for v5.2.0

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (v5.2.0+)

### Potential Improvements

**1. Module Auto-Loading (~1100ms potential)**

- Don't import ProfileCore at startup
- Let PowerShell load on first command
- Target: 100-300ms startup

**2. Further Lazy Loading**

- Plugin discovery
- Configuration validation
- Environment checks

**3. Cached Data**

- Prompt information
- Git status
- Directory info

**4. Rust Revisit (if justified)**

- Fix stack overflow issue
- Benchmark actual improvement
- Only if >20% additional gain

**Target:** Sub-500ms startup time
